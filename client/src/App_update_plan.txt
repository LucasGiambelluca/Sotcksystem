import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import FlowEditor from './pages/FlowEditor';
// ... other imports defined in original file ...

// I need to see the original content to splice it in correctly.
// For now, I will blindly assume I can replace the Router content or add to it.
// Better strategy: Read App.tsx first, then edit.
